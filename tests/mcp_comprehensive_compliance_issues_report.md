## Testing Strategy

All identified issues have corresponding test cases that:
- **Document the specific requirement** from the MCP specification
- **Provide test scenarios** that validate compliance
- **Mark expected failures** until implementation is complete
- **Enable TDD workflow** for systematic compliance achievement

## Next Steps

1. **Prioritize issues** based on criticality and dependencies
2. **Implement fixes** following the TDD approach established
3. **Run compliance test suite** to track progress
4. **Update this report** as issues are resolved
