# TurboMCP Security Policy & Architecture

## Comprehensive Security Strategy

TurboMCP implements enterprise-grade security through multiple defense layers, combining static analysis, runtime protection, and supply chain security.

## Security Layers

### 1. Supply Chain Security (cargo-deny)
- **Vulnerability Scanning**: Automatic detection of known security vulnerabilities in dependencies
- **License Compliance**: Ensures all dependencies meet licensing requirements
- **Dependency Auditing**: Tracks and validates the dependency tree
- **Supply Chain Protection**: Prevents malicious or unmaintained dependencies

### 2. File Security (turbomcp-security)
- **Path Validation**: Comprehensive canonicalization and traversal attack prevention
- **Resource Protection**: File size limits, directory depth limits, concurrency controls
- **Extension Filtering**: Configurable whitelist/blacklist for file types
- **Symlink Attack Detection**: Prevents directory traversal via symbolic links
- **Audit Logging**: Security event tracking for monitoring and compliance

### 3. Runtime Security
- **Timeout Controls**: Per-tool timeout limits with cancellation support
- **Memory Protection**: Zero-copy operations with bounds checking
- **Async Safety**: Non-blocking I/O operations with proper resource management
- **DoS Prevention**: Rate limiting and concurrent access controls

### 4. Cryptographic Security (DPoP)
- **Proof of Possession**: RFC 9449 compliant DPoP implementation
- **Key Rotation**: Automated key lifecycle management with background scheduling
- **Nonce Tracking**: Optional Redis-based distributed replay protection
- **Forward Security**: Regular key rotation for enhanced security posture

### 5. Transport Security
- **Unix Domain Sockets**: Secure local communication with path validation
- **WebSocket Security**: Optional TLS encryption with certificate validation
- **TCP Security**: Connection limits and timeout enforcement

## Configuration Examples

### Basic File Security Policy
```rust
use turbomcp_security::{SecurityPolicy, FileSecurityValidator};

let policy = SecurityPolicy::default()
    .max_file_size(10 * 1024 * 1024)  // 10MB limit
    .allowed_extensions(&[".json", ".txt", ".md"])
    .forbidden_paths(&["/etc", "/proc", "/sys"])
    .require_absolute_paths(true);

let validator = FileSecurityValidator::with_policies(
    policy,
    ResourcePolicy::default(),
    AuditLogger::new()
);
```

### cargo-deny Configuration
```toml
# deny.toml
[bans]
multiple-versions = "deny"
wildcards = "deny"

[licenses]
unlicensed = "deny"
allow = ["MIT", "Apache-2.0", "BSD-3-Clause"]

[advisories]
vulnerability = "deny"
unmaintained = "warn"
notice = "warn"
```

### Security Validation Workflow
```rust
async fn secure_file_operation(path: &Path) -> SecurityResult<Vec<u8>> {
    // 1. Path validation and canonicalization
    let safe_path = validator.validate_file_access(path).await?;

    // 2. Resource limit enforcement
    let content = tokio::fs::read(&safe_path).await?;

    // 3. Audit logging
    audit_logger.log_success("file_read", &safe_path).await;

    Ok(content)
}
```

## Security Benefits

### Defense in Depth
- **Multiple Validation Layers**: Each operation goes through comprehensive checks
- **Fail-Safe Defaults**: Conservative security posture by default
- **Comprehensive Logging**: Full audit trail for security monitoring

### Production Ready
- **Zero Configuration**: Secure defaults work out of the box
- **Performance Optimized**: Minimal overhead security checks
- **Enterprise Features**: Compliance-ready audit logging and monitoring

### Developer Experience
- **Clear Error Messages**: Detailed feedback for security violations
- **Flexible Configuration**: Policies can be customized per environment
- **Rich Documentation**: Security patterns and best practices included

## Compliance & Auditing

### Security Event Logging
All security-relevant events are logged with:
- **Timestamps**: ISO 8601 UTC timestamps
- **User Context**: Principal identification when available
- **Resource Information**: Paths, operations, and outcomes
- **Error Details**: Specific security violation reasons

### Metrics & Monitoring
- **Success/Failure Rates**: Security validation statistics
- **Performance Metrics**: Latency and throughput monitoring
- **Alerting Integration**: Critical security event notifications

## Best Practices

### Development Environment
- **cargo-deny Integration**: Run `cargo deny check` in CI/CD
- **Regular Updates**: Keep dependencies current with security patches
- **Security Testing**: Include security validation in test suites

### Production Deployment
- **Restrictive Policies**: Use minimal required permissions
- **Monitoring Setup**: Configure security event alerting
- **Regular Audits**: Review security logs and metrics

### Incident Response
- **Security Events**: Monitor for repeated violations or unusual patterns
- **Log Analysis**: Use structured logging for security investigation
- **Rapid Response**: Automated blocking of malicious behavior

## Architecture Decision Record

**Decision**: Use cargo-deny + comprehensive runtime validation instead of complex policy engines

**Rationale**:
- **Simplicity**: Easier to understand, configure, and maintain
- **Performance**: Lower overhead than full policy evaluation engines
- **Coverage**: cargo-deny handles supply chain, runtime validation handles operations
- **Reliability**: Battle-tested components with proven security track record

**Trade-offs**:
- Less complex policy expression capabilities than Cedar/OPA
- Configuration via code rather than external policy files
- Suitable for file operations and dependency management use cases

This architecture provides enterprise-grade security while maintaining operational simplicity and performance.
