# Declare expected cfgs from feature-gated code in the #[server] macro
# (transport, authentication, etc.)
#
# NOTE: This is a backward-compatibility accommodation. When the #[server] macro
# generates code without explicit transport specification, it conditionally generates
# methods for all transports. This workspace-level declaration tells the compiler
# "yes, these cfg conditions are expected and valid".
#
# BETTER PATTERN (v2.0.4+): Users who explicitly specify transports via the macro:
#   #[server(name = "my-server", transports = ["stdio", "http"])]
# will only generate cfg guards for their specified transports, requiring no
# workspace-level declarations and avoiding this code smell entirely.
#
# See .strategy/DILIGENCE_PASS_2.0.4_DX_IMPROVEMENTS.md for design rationale.
