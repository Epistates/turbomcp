## ⚠️ Known Issues & Considerations

This is an experimental release (1.1.0-exp.2) reflecting the latest development state with enhanced security and code quality. While comprehensively tested, please be aware:

### Testing Recommendations
1. **DPoP integration testing** - Validate compatibility with your OAuth 2.0 providers
2. **TLS configuration validation** - Test certificate pinning and mTLS in your environment  
3. **Performance baseline testing** - Measure performance characteristics for your workload
4. **Key management strategy** - Choose appropriate storage backend (memory/Redis/HSM) for production

### Production Deployment
- **Gradual rollout recommended** - Test security features in staging environments first
- **Monitor security audit logs** - New structured logging provides comprehensive security visibility
- **Backup key management** - Ensure proper key rotation and backup strategies for DPoP keys

## 🎯 Migration Guide

### From 1.0.x to 1.1.0-exp.2

Update your `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
# Previous version
turbomcp = "1.0.1"

# Latest experimental version
turbomcp = "1.1.0-exp.2"

# Optional: Add DPoP security features
turbomcp-dpop = "1.1.0-exp.2"
```

### Enabling Enhanced Security Features

#### DPoP OAuth 2.0 Security (Optional)
```rust
use turbomcp_dpop::{DpopKeyManager, DpopProofGenerator, DpopAlgorithm};

// Initialize DPoP with in-memory key storage
let key_manager = Arc::new(DpopKeyManager::new_memory().await?);
let dpop_generator = DpopProofGenerator::new(key_manager);

// Generate proof for OAuth 2.0 request
let proof = dpop_generator
    .generate_proof("POST", "https://auth.example.com/token", Some("access_token"))
    .await?;
```

#### Enterprise TLS Transport
```rust
use turbomcp_transport::tls::{TlsTransport, TlsConfig};

// Basic TLS configuration
let config = TlsConfig::new("server.crt", "server.key");
let server = TlsTransport::new_server("127.0.0.1:8443".parse()?, config).await?;

// Enhanced security with certificate pinning
let config = TlsConfig::new("server.crt", "server.key")
    .with_certificate_pinning("sha256:abcd1234...")
    .with_mutual_tls("client-ca.crt");
```

### OAuth 2.0 Security Levels
```rust
use turbomcp::auth::{SecurityLevel, AuthManager};

// Configure enhanced security with DPoP
let auth_config = AuthConfig {
    security_level: SecurityLevel::Enhanced, // Enables DPoP
    client_id: "your-client-id".to_string(),
    // ... other configuration
};
```
